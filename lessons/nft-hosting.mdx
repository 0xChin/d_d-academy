# NFT hosting through OpenSea and Rarible

Closing the gap:
The idea is that we close the gap from why do we need NFTs in the real world, through the journey of  creating them, to somewhere we can actually view or use them in the real world. Our example NFT will be hosted. e.g. Open Sea

## What are NFTs?

In the traditional world where you purchase an item, such as a piece of artwork, you become its new owner and youâ€™re able to physically take it home and hang it on your wall because it is a tangible item. If it is the *original,* there is only *one* which adds that element of rarity.

In the digital world, anything can be duplicated across the Internet which leaves the idea of an *original*, a concept that might be hard to prove. *NFTs* are able to solve this problem by connecting the *original* digital item to its owner. The digital item can be stored on a network such as IPFS or Arweave by way of a *cryptographic hash* that is nearly impossible to duplicate. The cryptographic hash is then deployed as a unique *non-fungible token* (a token that cannot be replaced with another) to a public blockchain such as Ethereum or Polygon. The deployment of the non-fungible token(NFT) is now recorded on the ledger of the blockchain and stands as a cryptographic record that your Ethereum wallet address is the owner of that unique NFT and no other address.

**NFTs** are disrupting many industries such as art and collectibles, medicine, investing and video gaming. Although **non-fungible tokens** have been disruptive over the last 2+ years, their full potential and capability as a means to transfer ownership has not been fully realized. The growth and use cases for NFTs are extensive and have a very bright future over the next 10 years.

Since its launch in December of 2017, OpenSea has grown into the largest digital marketplace in the world. As of June 2022, OpenSea has 200+ employees, 600K users, two million collections, over 80 million NFTs, and over $20 billion in trading volume([https://history-computer.com/opensea-history/](https://history-computer.com/opensea-history/)). 

On OpenSea, you can currently create your own NFTs on the Ethereum, Polygon and Solana mainnet blockchains as well as the Rinkeby testnet. The simple process of uploading your image, naming and giving the NFT a description, adding a URL link to where the image is located, creating or adding it to a collection, add properties to the new NFT, generate statistics for the listing, choose the supply and the blockchain to deploy the NFT to, then click `Create`. 
OpenSea will also render NFTs that you may have at your wallet address when you `Connect Wallet`.  It will also render NFTs by the smart contract address that created the NFT.
