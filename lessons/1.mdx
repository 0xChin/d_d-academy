# Lesson 1 - Intro to Smart Contract Development - Lesson

## What are we building?

To start up creating smart contracts, we are going to create a web3 "fortune-teller".

The idea is that our contract will receive a message and react to it, stating if we are going to make it or not in this space.

## **Let’s get this party started!**

Before we start, we need a place to write our smart contract in Solidity, and some tools to run it. For that we use an IDE, short for Integrated Development Environment.

## Setting up Remix (IDE)

To get started we will use the Remix IDE to write, compile, test and debug code quickly and easily. Head over to [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to see what it’s all about and get started. 

![Remix IDE Toolbar](/assets/lessons/1/img_1.png)

On the left hand side, in the File Explorer tab, delete all the files and folders in our workspace. We want to start fresh. Create a new folder named `contracts` and in it create a new file named `WAGMI.sol`.

The extension `.sol` is used for files in the Solidity language.

## **Now we begin writing our code**

The first line of a Solidity file is for the license, the second line lets the IDE’s compiler know which Solidity version we are working with.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
```

The MIT license is an open source license. We at Developer DAO love open source, and we love building public goods that others are free to build on… for free! The version of Solidity we’re working with is `0.8.4` and above(`^`).

## Diving into our Smart Contracts

A smart contract can contain data that can be modified (**~~state~~ variables**) and “recipes” with instructions (**functions**), that can be called/run whenever a user executes a transaction with them.

A contract in solidity is similar to a **class** in other programming languages.

Let’s create our first smart contract.

It is general practice to give the same name to the contract (uppercase first letter) and the contract’s solidity file. Let’s create a contract named `WAGMI` in our `WAGMI.sol` file.

The syntax for creating a basic smart contract is as follows:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

contract WAGMI {

    // ====== This is where we will write our code ======

}
```

We can use `//` as above to write line comments in solidity.

## Defining Variables

To begin with our work, we want our contract to be able to store a message from a user. We also want to keep a record of the number of any messages received from future users. So we store this information in variables. You can think of variables like containers. Different **types** of variable can store different types of information, e.g. numbers, ‘strings’ of text, addresses, etc. In this case we need **state *variables .*** State variables are persistent, meaning they live permanently in the contract. For the moment, we’ll just create them as placeholders with no value, but when we interact with our smart contract later, they will be *set* with actual values.

We chose `message` and `messageCount` as our variable names, and we will assign them the **types** `string` and `uint256` respectively.

- **More on Variables and Types (Add this to Sidedrawer)**
    
    [edit of ‘More on Variables and Types’](https://www.notion.so/edit-of-More-on-Variables-and-Types-2056c0bbe10541cfa868f1ae104b9e56)
    
    **Variables**
    
    There are two main forms of variables in Solidity i.e. State variables and Local variables.
    
    ![Vairables and their Scopes](/assets/lessons/1/img_2.png)
    
    A **State** variable can be accessed throughout the contract. Functions inside a contract can call and use a state variable. This is known as `global scope`. A state variable is permanently stored in the contract. Variables `message` and `messageCount` in our code are state variables.
    
    A **Local** variable is limited to the function within which it is defined and it cannot be used outside that function. This is known as `local scope`. A local variable is stored temporarily until the function in which it is defined, is executed.
    
    **Types**
    
    The type of each variable in Solidity needs to be specified. In addition, types can interact with each other in expressions containing operators (eg. comparing values).
    
    - **Value Types**: Store their own data. These are the basic data types provided by solidity. Some value types are as follows:
        - **Boolean:** This data type accepts only two values True or False.
        - **Integer:** This data type is used to store integer (a number without fractions) values, `int` and `uint` are used to declare *signed* and *unsigned integers* respectively.
        - **Address:** Address hold a 20-byte value which represents the size of an Ethereum address. An address can be used to get balance or to transfer a balance.
        - **Bytes and Strings:** Bytes are used to store a fixed-sized character set while the string is used to store the character set equal to or more than a byte. The length of bytes is from 1 to 32, while the string has a dynamic length. Byte has an advantage that it uses less gas, so better to use when we know the length of data.
    - **Reference Types**: Store the location of the data. They don’t share the data directly.
        - **Arrays:** An array is a group of variables of the same data type in which a variable has a particular location known as an index. By using the index location, the desired variable can be accessed. The array size can be of fixed or dynamic size.
        - **Struct:** Solidity allows users to create and define their own type in the form of structures. The structure is a group of different types even though it’s not possible to contain a member of its own type. The structure is a reference type variable which can contain both value types and reference types.
    - **Mapping Type**: Stores the data in a key-value pair where a key can be any value types. It is like a hash table or dictionary as in any other programming language, where data can be retrieved by key.
    

Let’s add our two state variable definitions inside our contract:

```solidity
// ...
contract WAGMI {

    string message;

    uint256 messageCount;

}
```

## Creating Functions

Our contract needs a way to store new information on the blockchain! But both our variables are *empty* and have no way of storing any info... *yet*.

That’s why we now need some **functions** to store and retrieve information to and from our contract on the blockchain. The basic syntax for a *public* function in Solidity would look like this:

```solidity
function functionName(uint256 value) public returns(bool) {

    // ====== Function logic here ======

}
```

- **More on Functions (Add this to Sidedrawer)**
    
    [edits: More on Functions ](https://www.notion.so/edits-More-on-Functions-f2e049d12a264040b23c8f562d63f6c6)
    
    Functions are the way we have to store logic inside a Smart Contract.
    
    They can receive typed parameters and also return them. Solidity is a typed language, so every parameter type must be specified.
    
    Writing data to the blockchain has cost, thus reference type parameters must indicate the data location. From more expensive to more cheap, these parameters can be in:
    
    - **storage**: it is a reference to stored data in the blockchain
    - **memory**: it is a reference to a place in memory
    - **calldata**: it is a read-only area where function parameters are stored. It behaves mostly like memory.
    
    Functions can have different purposes. In solidity we have to define what a function will be able to do (to asses if the function call will spend gas or not). A function can be:
    
    - **view**: it doesn’t write data to the blockchain state
    - **pure**: it doesn’t write or read data to or from the blockchain state
    
    If none of these is specified, it is assumed the function can write to the blockchain state and it will **always** spend gas when called.
    
    Also, since we can transfer value in the blockchain, we can specify another modifier:
    
    - **payable**: A function that can receive funds (ETH)
    
    Lastly, functions in smart contracts can be called from a varying set of points. For that we have visibility modifiers:
    
    - **external**: can be called from other contracts via transactions, but not internally (not directly)
    - **public**: can be called internally or from another contract
    - **internal**: can only be accessed from within the contract or contracts deriving from it. They cannot be accessed externally.
    - **private**: same as internal, but they are not visible in derived contracts

We want to be able to read both the message and the count, so we are going to create a function to *get* the value for each variable. Later on we can *set* (store) the values, but first let’s retrieve them. We have to add two new functions **below** our state variable definitions (do **not** delete our `message`and `messageCount` variables and please pay attention to all the {} ; and ()):

```solidity
// ...
contract WAGMI {

    // Don't delete our state variables here !

    function getMessage() public view returns(string memory) {
        return message;
    }

    function getMessageCount() public view returns(uint256) {
        return messageCount;
    }

}
```

Yes, there are some new keywords up there e.g. return, returns, view, etc, but don’t panic:

`public` defines the **visibility** of our function and means it can be called from anywhere e.g. directly calling it with our externally owned address, from another smart contract, or even from another function inside our smart contract. We can use a public function for making a transaction, or querying a value from a contract.

`view` means the function **can’t** modify the blockchain state, so it doesn’t store any value or triggers a transaction by itself. It is useful for querying information from a contract, such as an account balance.

`memory` tells us where the variable lives (for some types we have to tell solidity if a variable is in `memory`, `storage`or `calldata`). We can leave these concepts for future lessons, or if you can’t wait that long, you can read some more about them in **Variables** and **Functions**.

Ok, now we have to figure out a way to store some info on our contract!

We want to *set* a new message in our contract, so now we define a new function below the ones we recently created. The function should receive a new message as a parameter, store it in our state variable and also update the message count: 

```solidity
function setMessage(string calldata newMessage) public {

    // We add 1 to the messageCount state variable
    messageCount++;

    // We update the message state variable
    message = newMessage;
}
```

If you noticed, this function does **not** have the `view` visibility keyword and it **does** indeed modify the state of our contract and the blockchain. Therefore, whenever someone calls this function in the future, their wallet is going to ask them to confirm a transaction on the blockchain. That means it will use some **gas**, which is a transaction fee of a small amount of **eth**, since we are using the **Ethereum** blockchain. As we progress in our learning we will see some more on **Gas and Fees**, but that’s also for another lesson.

## Events

So far, we’ve learned to how make our contract store a message on the blockchain, and how we can use a function to retrieve it. But every time we store a new message, we overwrite the old one.

We would love to have a history of the messages, but storing everything on-chain is expensive. Fortunately, every transaction has **transaction logs** and we can store a limited amount of info in them more cheaply than we can on-chain.

**Transaction logs** are not accessible from our smart contract, but we will be able to read them from any Ethereum **node** after we’ve developed our front-end.

To make this possible, we need to **define** an `event` and then we can make any of our functions **emit** it.

When our function emits it, the values used in the **parameters** will be stored in the transaction logs. We usually define our events near the top of the contract, under the state variables.

The basic syntax for defining an event with 3 parameters would be:

```solidity
event EventName(uint256 indexed param1, bool param2, string param3);
```

In Solidity, there are two types of event parameter. The first type we define with our **indexed** keyword. This allows us to find past events on the blockchain if we need to by using filters on their parameters. The other type is simply not indexed and therefore not searchable. Each event can have multiple parameters, but we can only make three of them indexed.

- Indexed Event Parameters (Add this to Sidedrawer)
    
    Blockchain keeps event parameters in transaction logs. Transaction logs remains in the blockchain as long as the block is accessible.
    
    Event parameters can be either `indexed` or not indexed.
    
    Based on that, parameters will be stored in different parts of the transaction log: **topics** and **data**.
    
    - `indexed` parameters will be stored in the **topics** sections of the log
    - non-indexed parameters will be ABI-encoded into the **data** portion of the log
    
    Once the event data is stored inside the transaction log in a block, we can later on filter events.
    
    We can filter events by name and by contract address, and by any parameters stored in the topics part of the logs, hence using the `indexed` keyword, we have a way to retrieve specific events emitted.
    
    For example, we can search for all the Transfers of a certain ERC20 Token, from or to a specific address.
    

Our function will **emit** the event each time we need to log that “something happened”, i.e. someone called setMessage, or anything we want, it is a log.

Thus, to emit one using the example event above we can write:

```solidity
emit EventName(2, false, 'Hello World!');
```

There’s a lot to unpack, so let’s leave it at that for now and create an event to log all the messages sent to our smart contract… and see if the message sent is worthy of “making it” in the web3 world. 😉

So, after our state variables, we can define our new event as:

```solidity
// We add this line after our 'message' and 'messageCount' definitions
event web3Future(uint256 indexed messageIndex, address indexed author, string message, string future);
```

Notice that our second parameter is defined with a new type: `address`. We use this type for Ethereum addresses, be them **wallets** or other **smart contracts**. Yes, that is also for another lesson 😉 (try searching for **EOAs vs. Contract Accounts** if you can’t wait that long!).

Inside our `setMessage` function, we should emit the event. But before that, let’s decide if the message is GMI or NGMI:

```solidity
function setMessage(string calldata newMessage) public {

    // We leave our previous code
    messageCount++;

    message = newMessage;

    // ====== Here begins our new code ======

    // We create a local variable in memory to decide if GMI or NGMI
    string memory future = 'NGMI';

    // Only if the new message is 'gm', we change it to a fun response ;o)
    if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(newMessage)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked('gm'))) {
        future = 'WAGMI';
    }

    // We emit the event notifying the change of our state variable
    emit web3Future(messageCount, msg.sender, newMessage, future);

    // ====== End of new code ======
}
```

If you were wondering what `msg.sender` is, we can simplify it as the Ethereum address that called the function. You also probably noticed how we compare newMessage with `‘gm’`. That’s because Solidity doesn’t have a way to easily compare two text strings, so we are using `abi.encodePacked()` to convert the string into `bytes` and then using the hashing function `keccak256()` to compare the two “hashes”, and if they are equal, the strings are equal 🙌.  We can dive deep on these in future lessons, so no worries!

- **More on Events (Add this to Sidedrawer)**
    
    In the Ethereum Blockchain, whenever we run or execute a transaction it stores a log with the results and data of the transaction. Solidity provides us with **Events** so we can write data to said logs.
    
    Applications can subscribe and listen to this events, or even search for past logs using filters.
    
    Whenever a function calls (**emits**) an event, the values passed as parameters are stored in a special data structure in the blockchain: the transaction log. It is worth noticing that Smart Contracts cannot access the log and its event data.
    
    If we define a parameter as `indexed`, instead of being added to the data part of the log, it is added to a special data structure called **topics** instead of the data part of the log. A topic can only hold a single word of 32 bytes, so if we use a **reference type**, only its hash is stored (using keccak-256). Each event can **only** hold a maximum of 3 `indexed` parameters.
    
    Topics are what lets us search for events in the blockchain logs. We can filter them by a specific event, the contract address that emitted them,  and any indexed parameters defined in the event.
    

We should ask the learner to sum up what they have learned. 
*see the **Comment*** in the very last line of this lesson under ‘Now, please go ahead and hop in the forum/discord to tell us: **what is your future in web3?’** 

## Compile & Deploy

Now that we have written our smart contract in full, we can compile it and deploy it to a blockchain. Since we are using the Remix IDE, we can use its tools in the sidebar for this. Here’s a brief description of the tools icons:

![Remix Menu](/assets/lessons/1/img_3.png)

At the top, the logo links us to the Home (and Help links) of Remix 

Then, we have our File Explorer

The magnifying glass icon is for searching in files

Highlighted in red, the Solidity Compiler (our next step)

Highlighted in red, the Solidity Compiler (our next step)

To compile our smart contract we should click on the **Solidity Compiler** icon in the sidebar (marked in the red box).

Leave all the settings in their default, manually select our contract in the drop down menu and click on the **Compile WAGMI.sol** button.

![Remix Contract Compiler Button](/assets/lessons/1/img_4.png)

![Remix Successful Compilation Indicator](/assets/lessons/1/img_5.png)

After compiling, we should see a green check mark on top of the Solidity Compiler sidebar icon.

- Problems at Compile time (Add this to Sidedrawer)?
    
    First, check that you have selected a compiler compatible with our version (0.8.4 or any higher inside the 0.8 version).
    
    If you still have any problems when compiling, you can compare your code to my final code. Mine looks like this (with most comments removed for readability):
    
    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
    
    contract WAGMI {
    
        // State Variables
        string message;
        uint256 messageCount;
    
        // Events
        event Web3Future(uint256 indexed messageIndex, address indexed author, string message, string future);
    
        // Functions
        function getMessage() public view returns(string memory) {
            return message;
        }
    
        function getMessageCount() public view returns(uint256) {
            return messageCount;
        }
    
        function setMessage(string calldata newMessage) public {
            messageCount++;
            message = newMessage;
    
            string memory future = 'NGMI';
            if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(newMessage)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked('gm'))) {
                future = 'WAGMI';
            }
    
            emit Web3Future(messageCount, msg.sender, newMessage, future);
        }
    
    }
    ```
    

Now we are ready to deploy our contract. We can now head to the **Deploy & Run transactions** icon in the sidebar (marked in the green box). Below we can see a message that says ‘Currently you have no contract instances to interact with’, so we haven’t deployed anything yet.

![Contract Instance Warning](/assets/lessons/1/img_6.png)

Again, we are leaving all options to default for now (we’ll be learning how to deploy to a testnet later on). Click on the **Deploy** button!

Once deployment finishes, we are going to see our shiny new deployed contract instance below.

Open the dropdown under ‘Deployed Contracts’, to see our function tabs:

- the blue ones are our “**view**” functions that doesn’t modify our state
- the orange one lets usFrom here on, we can interact with our contract. Feel free to test the functions. Click on the getMessage and messageCount tabs before and after setting a new message. modify data on our contract.

![Available Interactive Options once Contract is Deployed](/assets/lessons/1/img_7.png)

From here on, we can interact with our contract. Feel free to test the functions. Click on the getMessage and messageCount tabs before and after setting a new message.

On the right hand side, below our contract code, there’s a bar on the bottom. If it hasn’t opened automatically, we can open the console from here to see any transactions with the green check mark. The first transaction is the deployment of our contract. Click it to open it.

![Button to Minimise and Maximise Console](/assets/lessons/1/img_8.png)

Once you *set* a new message, you’ll see again, that the transaction has a green check mark, open it and look for the “**logs**”. Here’s my info after setting the message to “**My first smart contract**”:

![Complete Transaction Log of Deployed Contract](/assets/lessons/1/img_9.png)

If you look closely, inside the “logs” part, our smart contract predicted a “future” for us.

What if you try out setting the message to `gm` and look at the logs again. Can you see the magical spell that is being cast here?
