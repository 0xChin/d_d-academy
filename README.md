## Developer DAO - School of Code

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

    node --version 16.x

Refer to the `node` and `npm` installation with `nvm` guide in Lesson 2. A link
to the guide can be found
[here](https://www.notion.so/How-to-install-node-js-and-npm-67b2ab1f76f148f49f547b9156aeaf28):

**Clone and `cd` into the repo:**

    git clone https://github.com/Developer-DAO/school-of-code.git
    cd school-of-code/

**Installation and run:**

    yarn install
    yarn dev

This will create a local instance of the app running and can be viewed at
`http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Grabbing latest version of the code

**Since this is a work in progress, your local version of the app can be updated
with the following commands:**

Stop the locally running app with:

    Ctrl + C

Use `git pull` for the most up-to-date version:

    git pull

Reinstall with `yarn`:

    yarn install

Run the updated app:

    yarn dev
