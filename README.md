## Developer DAO - School of Code 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started


**Prerequisites:**

          node --version 16.x

Refer to the `node` and `npm` installation with `nvm` guide in Lesson 2. A link to the guide can be found here:
https://www.notion.so/How-to-install-node-js-and-npm-67b2ab1f76f148f49f547b9156aeaf28

**Clone and `cd` into the repo:** 

           git clone https://github.com/Developer-DAO/school-of-code.git
           cd school-of-code/

**Installation and run:**

           yarn install 

           yarn dev

This will create a local instance of the app running and can be viewed at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.<br>
                                                                                                                                                                                 <br>



**Since this is a work in progress, your local version of the app can be updated with the following commands:**

Stop the app with:

           Ctrl + C

Use `git pull` for the most up-to-date version:

           git pull https://github.com/Developer-DAO/school-of-code.git

Reinstall with `yarn`:

           yarn install

Run the updated app:

           yarn dev
